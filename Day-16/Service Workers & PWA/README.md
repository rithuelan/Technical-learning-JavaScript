Service Workers & PWA
Why

To make web apps fast, reliable, and engaging, even on unstable or offline networks.

Traditional web apps rely on network requests, which can fail or be slow.

Service Workers and PWAs allow apps to work offline, cache assets, send notifications, and behave more like native apps.

What

Service Worker (SW): A JavaScript file that runs in the background (separate from the web page) and intercepts network requests.

Handles offline caching, background sync, and push notifications.

PWA (Progressive Web App): A web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver a native app-like experience.

Key features: offline support, installable on devices, background tasks, push notifications, fast load.

How We Use It

Offline caching: Cache HTML, CSS, JS, and assets so the app loads even without an internet connection.

Background sync: Queue user actions (like sending forms) and sync them when the network is available.

Installable app: Users can “install” the web app to their device, giving access from the home screen and launching like a native app.

Push notifications: Inform users of updates or messages even when the app isn’t open.

Setup & Run Instructions

Create project folder with HTML, CSS, JS, and manifest file.

Register a Service Worker in your main JavaScript file:

The SW file runs in the background, handling caching and sync.

Serve files via HTTPS or localhost (Service Workers require secure context).

npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8080


Open in browser: Go to http://localhost:8080.

Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers to see registration.

Test offline mode by disabling network in DevTools.

Add Web App Manifest: Include name, icons, theme color to enable “install” prompt on supported browsers.

Understanding

Service Workers run separately from your web page, allowing background tasks without blocking the main thread.

Offline caching strategy: Cache assets during install, serve cached assets during fetch requests.

Background sync: Useful for deferred actions when offline (e.g., sending messages, form submissions).

Installable apps: PWAs allow users to add your web app to the home screen and launch it full-screen, similar to native apps.

Performance & reliability: Using Service Workers, PWAs load faster, handle network interruptions gracefully, and improve UX significantly.

Summary:
Service Workers & PWAs turn ordinary websites into resilient, offline-capable, installable apps with background tasks. They combine offline caching, background sync, and native-like features to deliver a modern app experience without native development.
